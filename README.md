# DirectCacheRAMInterfaceRTL
This project involves the RTL design and verification of a direct-mapped cache memory system integrated with RAM and a control unit, implemented using Xilinx Vivado. The system supports a 15-bit address input, managing a 128-bit cache line with 1024 entries.


## âœ¨ Key Features



- **Cache Architecture:**  
  - Direct-mapped cache with 1024 entries, each storing a 128-bit data line.


- **Address Handling:**  
  - 15-bit address input mapped to cache lines for seamless memory access.


- **Control Unit:**  
  - FSM-based controller to orchestrate cache operations, including hit/miss detection and data synchronization.


- **Synchronization:**  
  -  Read/write handshake signals ensure efficient cache-RAM communication.

 
- **Verification:**  
  -  Thorough validation using Xilinx Vivado, confirming design reliability and performance.
